I was able to attempt both the tasks given to us, however google colab was taking too much time to upload the dataset fir the first task, hence I have uploaded the normal .ipynb file for task 1. It already have pre-executed cells hence there is already output present in the file. However choose to run the file, you ccan still do so without any hassle. You can download the entire task 1 folder and run the file cell by cell to get the desired output. The directory already consists of the datset needed, the trained model and the mp3 speech file for testing. For testing, you dont need to run cells dealing with the model, just run everything brfore creating a model and then you can just run the last cell which loads a pre-trained model from a file.
